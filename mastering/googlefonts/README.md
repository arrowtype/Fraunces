# Making PRs to google/fonts for updates

(First, you must set up your build environment. See the main project readme for instructions.)

You can use `mastering/googlefonts/update-gfonts-repo.sh` to make PRs to [google/fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts).

Previously, the gftools packager was used to make PRs, but this had issues. So, the associated files are moved to `mastering/googlefonts/gftools-packager-deprecated`, in case these become relevant again.

NOTE: You need push access to google/fonts for the `update-gfonts-repo.sh` to work.

If you do not have push access to google/fonts but you wish to update Fraunces on Google Fonts, please file an issue at [google/fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts), and someone will help figure out what to do.
